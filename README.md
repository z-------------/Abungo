## Install

### Dependencies

Abungo is dependent on:

+ [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
+ [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
+ a bunch of npm packages that you can install using `npm install`. Namely:
  + `express`
  + `jade`
  + `node-sass`
  + `socket.io`

### Running

`cd` to the directory in which you put Abungo and do `node server.js`.

You can also start it with something like [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) if you want to be able to set the `PORT` and other environment variables (not as useful in v1 as it used to be).
