## Install

### Dependencies

Abungo is dependent on:

+ [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
+ [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
+ a bunch of npm packages that you can install using `npm install`. Namely:
  + `express`
  + `jade`
  + `node-sass`
  + `socket.io`

### Running

`cd` to the Abungo directory and do `node server.js`.

You can also start it with something like [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) if you want to be able to set the `PORT` and other environment variables.

You can also check it out online at https://abungo.herokuapp.com.

### To-do

This is a list of things that I plan to add to Abungo in the future. They may or may not ever happen.

+ Modular attachment plugin system
+ Video chat
